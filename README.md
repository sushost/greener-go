# 🌱 GREENER-GO  
*A privacy-first, low-energy Google search launcher*

**GREENER-GO** is a tiny self-hostable search launcher that sends queries to Google’s **Web Results** view (`udm=14`) — skipping AI overviews, disabling search-history personalization, and avoiding cookies or trackers.  
It includes an optional minimal PHP/MariaDB script that estimates energy and water saved by avoiding AI compute.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **No cookies / trackers / third-party scripts**  
- ✅ **Dark mode by default**, with `?theme=light` override  
- ✅ **Bypasses Google AI Overviews** via `udm=14`  
- ✅ **Disables search history personalization** (`pws=0`)  
- ✅ **Optional “eco counter”** with one tiny PHP file + 1 MariaDB table  
- ✅ Works even if the backend is offline — fails gracefully

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements
- A PHP host (PHP ≥ 7.0)  
- MariaDB/MySQL (for the optional eco-counter)  
- APCu recommended, but not required

### 1️⃣ Clone or download this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SustainableHosting/greener-go.git
cd greener-go

Or just download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it into your site’s web root.

2️⃣ Database setup (eco-counter)

Create the database, user, and table. Example:

CREATE DATABASE eco CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;

CREATE USER 'eco_app'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON eco.* TO 'eco_app'@'127.0.0.1';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

USE eco;
CREATE TABLE eco_counter (
  id TINYINT PRIMARY KEY CHECK (id=1),
  total_searches BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  energy_saved_wh DOUBLE NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  water_saved_ml DOUBLE NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO eco_counter (id) VALUES (1);


📝 Important: Edit eco.php to set your database password and, if needed, host/user details.

3️⃣ Create the salt file

Generate a random salt outside the web root, e.g.:

mkdir ../private
openssl rand -hex 32 > ../private/eco_salt
chown webXXX:clientX ../private/eco_salt
chmod 0640 ../private/eco_salt

4️⃣ Test

Visit:

https://yourdomain/eco.php?mode=read


You should see JSON with "ok":true.

5️⃣ Optional icons

The repository doesn’t include favicons, web app icons, or manifests.
If you want this to behave like a “homepage” or default search engine, provide your own icons and link them in the <head> of index.html.

📚 Why

Modern search interfaces are increasingly AI-augmented, which:

Consumes extra energy and water per query,

Encourages deeper personalization and profiling,

Ships more client-side JavaScript bloat.

GREENER-GO demonstrates how minimal HTML and a few smart URL parameters can offer a cleaner, privacy-respecting, lower-energy search experience.

🧠 FAQ

Q: What happens if the database goes down?
A: The page still works — searches keep working. The eco-counter simply shows “unavailable” until the backend is back.

Q: Can I use this as my default browser search engine?
A: Not yet — but support via an OpenSearch XML descriptor is planned. Contributions welcome.

Q: Can I customize the look?
A: Absolutely — just edit index.html. It’s a single file with inline CSS and minimal JS.
